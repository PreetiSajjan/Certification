# Certification
Udacity certified Computer Vision Nanodegree Graduate

Master the computer vision skills behind advances in robotics and automation. This course covers the latest in deep learning architectures used in industry, including region-based convolutional neural networks and fast object recognition algorithms such as YOLO (“You Only Look Once” multiple object detection) and SLAM ("Simultaneous localization and mapping").
This course helped me to gain practical skills by programming computer vision applications, extract information from any kind of image and spatial data, and solve real-world challenges.

This curriculum is built in collaboration with Affectiva and NVIDIA.
